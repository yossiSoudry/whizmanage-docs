The system enables you to create different versions of the same basic product, such as different sizes and colors, while maintaining separate inventory tracking for each variation.\n\n### What Are Product Variations?\n\nProduct variations allow you to offer the same product in multiple different versions. For example:\n\n* A shirt in various colors and sizes\n* A phone with different storage capacities\n* Glasses with different frame colors\n\n<img src=\"https://placehold.co/800x300?text=Example+of+product+variations\" alt=\"Example of product variations\" />\n\n### Benefits of Using Variations\n\n1. **Efficient Inventory Management**\n\n* Separate tracking for each product version\n* Automated inventory alerts\n* Detailed reports for each variation\n\n2. **Enhanced User Experience**\n\n* Intuitive selection interface\n* Clear presentation of all options\n* Prevention of confusion between different versions\n\n3. **Pricing Flexibility**\n\n* Ability to set different prices for each variation\n* Special offers for specific variations\n* Dynamic pricing based on product attributes\n\n### System Structure\n\nThe variations system consists of several key components:\n\n<CardGrid>\n  <Card subtitle=\"First Component\" title=\"Attributes\" description=\"Define the characteristics that create differences between variations.

החלים.\n\n## שימוש ומיקום נתונים\n\n**מתן שירות**\n\nאנחנו משתמשים בנתונים כדי לספק ולנהל את השירותים שלנו, כולל השלמת עסקאות, מתן גישה לתוכנה והצעת תמיכה טכנית. הנתונים מאפשרים לנו להבטיח שימוש בשירותים שלנו בצורה חלקה ויעילה.\n\n**שיפור שירות**\n\nאנחנו מנתחים את הנתונים שנאספו כדי לשפר את השירותים והמוצרים שלנו. המידע הזה עוזר לנו להבין צרכים, לזהות מגמות שימוש, לתקן בעיות טכניות ולפתח תכונות חדשות.\n\n**תקשורת**\n\nאנחנו משתמשים בנתונים כדי לתקשר, לשלוח עדכונים על השירותים שלנו, להודיע על שינויי מדיניות או תנאים ולהגיב לפניות ובקשות. התקשורת כוללת גם שליחת הודעות שיווקיות והצעות

באיחוד האירופי וחוקים אחרים במדינות שונות כדי להבטיח את הגנת הפרטיות.\n\nבעת העברת נתונים בין מדינות שונות, אנחנו נוקטים אמצעי אבטחה מתאימים כדי להבטיח שהנתונים מוגנים באותה רמה כמו במדינת המגורים. העברות אלה נעשות בהתאם להסכמים משפטיים מחייבים, כמו סעיפים חוזיים סטנדרטיים שאושרו על ידי הרגולטורים הרלוונטיים.\n\nרק עובדים מורשים וספקי שירותים עם צורך עסקי לגיטימי יקבלו גישה לנתונים. אנחנו עוקבים

ומעובדים על ידם בלבד.\n\nכאשר הנתונים האישיים אינם נחוצים עוד למטרות המתוארות במדיניות זו, ננקוט צעדים למחיקה בטוחה או אנונימיזציה שלהם כך שלא ניתן יהיה לזהות על בסיסם.\n\n**אמצעי אבטחה טכנולוגיים**\n\nאנחנו משתמשים בטכנולוגיות הצפנה מתקדמות כדי להגן על הנתונים האישיים במהלך העברה ואחסון.\n\n**בקרות פנימיות**\n\nאנחנו מבצעים ביקורות קבועות של מערכות האבטחה והתהליכים הפנימיים שלנו כדי להבטיח ציות לתקני אבטחת מידע ולמדיניות הפנימית שלנו. אנחנו מקיימים תוכניות ניהול סיכונים ואבטחת מידע מקיפות כדי להבטיח את שלמות הנתונים הן במערכות שלנו והן אצל ספקי שירותים חיצוניים שאיתם אנחנו עובדים.\n\nאמצעים אלה כוללים הצפנת נתונים, פרוטוקולי אבטחה מתקדמים והגבלת הגישה לנתונים לעובדים מורשים בלבד. עם זאת, חשוב לציין שטכנולוגיות אבטחה אינן מושלמות, ואיננו יכולים להבטיח הגנה מוחלטת מפני חדירות או גניבת נתונים.\n\n## שיתוף ותקשורת\n\n**שיתוף נתונים**\n\nאנחנו משתפים נתונים עם ספקי שירותים חיצוניים המסייעים לנו בפעילות העסקית שלנו. ספקים אלה עשויים לכלול ספקי שירותי ענן, ספקי אחסון נתונים, ספקי תמיכה טכנית ושירותי עיבוד תשלומים. כל ספקי השירותים שלנו כפופים להסכמי סודיות ואבטחה קפדניים.\n\nאנחנו עשויים לשתף נתונים כאשר נדרש על פי חוק, צו בית משפט או בקשה חוקית מרשות ממשלתית. שיתוף זה עשוי לכלול העברת נתונים לרשויות אכיפת החוק, רגולטורים או גופים משפטיים אחרים.\n\nבמקרים מסוימים, אנחנו עשויים לשתף נתונים עם צדדים שלישיים על בסיס הסכמה מפורשת. הסכמה זו תינתן בעת השימוש בשירותים שלנו או במקרים אחרים שבהם תתבקשו לאשר את שיתוף הנתונים.\n\n**תקשורת**\n\nאנחנו עשויים ליצור קשר בנוגע לשירותים שלנו ותקשורת פרומוציונלית. המדיניות שלנו כוללת את ההיבטים הבאים:\n\nתקשורת עשויה לכלול שליחת הודעות דואר אלקטרוני או הודעות טקסט לאישור הזמנות ועדכון על הסטטוס שלהן, מתן תגובות לפניות למרכז התמיכה שלנו, פתרון בעיות טכניות והצעת סיוע נוסף.\n\nשליחת עדכונים על שינויים בתנאי השירות,
