A progress indicator will be displayed during processing\n\n    <img src=\"https://placehold.co/800x300?text=Start+processing+button\" alt=\"Start processing button\" />\n  </StepItem>\n</Step>\n\n### WooCommerce File Structure\n\nA standard WooCommerce file includes the following main columns:\n\n| Column | Description | Example |\r\n|-------|--------|--------|\r\n| **ID** | Unique product identifier | 123 |\r\n| **Type** | Product type | simple, variable, variation |\r\n| **SKU** | Unique catalog number | ABC-123 |\r\n| **Name** | Product name | Cotton Shirt |\r\n| **Published** | Publication status | 1 (yes) or 0 (no) |\r\n| **Regular price** | Regular price | 99.90 |\r\n| **Sale price** | Sale price | 79.90 |\r\n| **Categories** | Categories | Clothing, Shirts |\r\n| **Images** | Links to images | http://example.com/image.jpg |\r\n| **Attribute X name** | Attribute name | Color |\r\n| **Attribute X value(s)** | Attribute values | Red, Blue, Green |\n\n<Note title=\"Important\" type=\"warning\">\n  The WhizManage system automatically identifies columns even if they're in Hebrew, but it's recommended to use an English file for maximum compatibility.\n</Note>\n\n### Handling Variations\n\nWhen importing products with variations:\n\n1. **File Structure**\n   * The parent product (`variable`) appears first\n   * Followed by all variations (`variation`)\n   * Variations are linked to the parent via the `Parent` field\n\n2. **Attribute Handling**\n   * `Attribute X name` columns define attribute names\n   * `Attribute X value(s)` columns define the options\n   * `Attribute X visible` columns define if the attribute is visible\n   * `Attribute X global` columns define if the attribute is global\n\n<img src=\"https://placehold.co/800x300?text=Variations+structure+in+CSV\" alt=\"Variations structure in CSV file\" />\n\n### Tips for Successful Import from WooCommerce\n\n1. **File Preparation**\n   * Maintain the original column structure\n   * Ensure SKUs are unique\n   * Verify that image links are valid and accessible\n\n2. **During Import**\n   * Start with a small import for testing\n   * Pay attention to required fields\n   * Use the review table to verify data accuracy\n\n3. **Troubleshooting Common Issues**\n   * Character encoding issues: ensure the file is in UTF-8 encoding\n   * Attribute issues: check the structure and format of attribute values\n   * Product relationships: ensure correct order of parent products and variations\n\n<Note title=\"Important\" type=\"warning\">\n  Complex imports with hundreds of products and variations may take a long time. Do not close the window or refresh the page during the process.\n</Note>\n"

The system enables you to create different versions of the same basic product, such as different sizes and colors, while maintaining separate inventory tracking for each variation.\n\n### What Are Product Variations?\n\nProduct variations allow you to offer the same product in multiple different versions. For example:\n\n* A shirt in various colors and sizes\n* A phone with different storage capacities\n* Glasses with different frame colors\n\n<img src=\"https://placehold.co/800x300?text=Example+of+product+variations\" alt=\"Example of product variations\" />\n\n### Benefits of Using Variations\n\n1. **Efficient Inventory Management**\n\n* Separate tracking for each product version\n* Automated inventory alerts\n* Detailed reports for each variation\n\n2. **Enhanced User Experience**\n\n* Intuitive selection interface\n* Clear presentation of all options\n* Prevention of confusion between different versions\n\n3. **Pricing Flexibility**\n\n* Ability to set different prices for each variation\n* Special offers for specific variations\n* Dynamic pricing based on product attributes\n\n### System Structure\n\nThe variations system consists of several key components:\n\n<CardGrid>\n  <Card subtitle=\"First Component\" title=\"Attributes\" description=\"Define the characteristics that create differences between variations.

שמרו על מבנה העמודות המקורי\n   * וודאו שה-SKU ייחודיים\n   * בדקו שהקישורים לתמונות תקינים ונגישים\n\n2. **בעת הייבוא**\n   * התחילו עם ייבוא קטן לבדיקה\n   * שימו לב לשדות החובה\n   * השתמשו בטבלת הסקירה לוודא נכונות נתונים\n\n3. **פתרון בעיות נפוצות**\n   * בעיות קידוד תווים: וודאו שהקובץ בקידוד UTF-8\n   * בעיות עם תכונות: בדקו את המבנה והפורמט של ערכי התכונה\n   * קשרים בין מוצרים: וודאו סדר נכון של מוצרי אב וווריאציות\n\n<Note title=\"חשוב\" type=\"warning\">\n  ייבוא מורכב עם מאות מוצרים וווריאציות עשוי לארוך זמן רב. אל תסגרו את החלון או תרעננו את הדף במהלך התהליך.\n</Note>\n"
