    "content": "Diagrams are powerful tools for visualizing processes, relationships, and decisions. This section showcases different types of diagrams created using **Mermaid**, complete with examples and reusable code snippets to integrate into your projects.\n\n## Flowchart\n\nA flowchart represents a sequence of steps or processes in a visual format. Use this diagram to map workflows, decision-making processes, or operational flows.\n\n```jsx\n<Mermaid\r\n  chart={\\`\r\n    graph TD;\r\n    Start --> Task1;\r\n    Task1 --> Task2;\r\n    Task2 --> End;\r\n  \\`}\r\n/>\n```\n\n## Decision Tree\n\nDecision trees illustrate choices and possible outcomes, making them ideal for decision-making workflows or processes involving multiple paths.\n\n```jsx\n<Mermaid\r\n  chart={\\`\r\n    graph TD;\r\n    A[Start] --> B{Is it raining?};\r\n    B -->|Yes| C[Take an umbrella];\r\n    B -->|No| D[Enjoy the weather];\r\n    C --> E[Go outside];\r\n    D --> E;\r\n  \\`}\r\n/>\n```\n\n## Entity-Relationship Diagram\n\nEntity-relationship diagrams (ERDs) are used to model relationships between entities in a system. They are widely used in database design and system architecture planning.\n\n```jsx\n<Mermaid\r\n  chart={\\`\r\n    erDiagram\r\n    CUSTOMER ||--o{ ORDER : places\r\n    ORDER ||--|{ LINE-ITEM : contains\r\n    PRODUCT ||--o{ LINE-ITEM : \"included in\"\r\n    CUSTOMER {\r\n        string name\r\n        string email\r\n    }\r\n    ORDER {\r\n        int orderNumber\r\n        date orderDate\r\n    }\r\n    LINE-ITEM {\r\n        int quantity\r\n        float price\r\n    }\r\n    PRODUCT {\r\n        int productId\r\n        string name\r\n        float price\r\n    }\r\n  \\`}\r\n/>\n```\n\nEach of these diagrams serves a specific purpose and Mermaid makes it easy to generate them dynamically. Feel free to experiment with the provided code snippets and adapt them to your needs.\n"

This is particularly useful for documentation, tutorials, or providing users with an overview of your project's architecture.\n\n### JSX Code Example\n\nHere is how you can define the file tree structure in for use in your project:\n\n```jsx\n<FileTree>\r\n  <Folder name=\"src\" label=\"Source Code\">\r\n    <File name=\"index.tsx\" label=\"Index File\" />\r\n    <Folder name=\"components\" label=\"Components\">\r\n      <File name=\"button.tsx\" label=\"Button Component\" />\r\n      <File name=\"input.tsx\" label=\"Input Component\" />\r\n    </Folder>\r\n    <Folder name=\"pages\" label=\"Pages\">\r\n      <File name=\"home.tsx\" label=\"Home Page\" />\r\n      <File name=\"about.tsx\" label=\"About Page\" />\r\n    </Folder>\r\n  </Folder>\r\n</FileTree>\n```\n\nUse this code as a template to set up your own file tree structure and customize it as needed.\n"

    "content": "## Introduction\n\nProduct variations management is one of the most crucial components in running an online store. The system enables you to create different versions of the same basic product, such as different sizes and colors, while maintaining separate inventory tracking for each variation.\n\n### What Are Product Variations?\n\nProduct variations allow you to offer the same product in multiple different versions. For example:\n\n* A shirt in various colors and sizes\n* A phone with different storage capacities\n* Glasses with different frame colors\n\n<img src=\"https://placehold.co/800x300?text=Example+of+product+variations\" alt=\"Example of product variations\" />\n\n### Benefits of Using Variations\n\n1. **Efficient Inventory Management**\n\n* Separate tracking for each product version\n* Automated inventory alerts\n* Detailed reports for each variation\n\n2. **Enhanced User Experience**\n\n* Intuitive selection interface\n* Clear presentation of all options\n* Prevention of confusion between different versions\n\n3. **Pricing Flexibility**\n\n* Ability to set different prices for each variation\n* Special offers for specific variations\n* Dynamic pricing based on product attributes\n\n### System Structure\n\nThe variations system consists of several key components:\n\n<CardGrid>\n  <Card subtitle=\"First Component\" title=\"Attributes\" description=\"Define the characteristics that create differences between variations. For example: color, size, material.\" href=\"/en/docs/variations/attributes\" external={true} />\n\n  <Card subtitle=\"Second Component\" title=\"Options\" description=\"The possible values for each attribute. For example: for color - red, blue, green.\" href=\"/en/docs/variations/options\" external={true} />\n\n  <Card subtitle=\"Third Component\" title=\"Creating Variations\" description=\"The process of creating different combinations of options that form the different product versions.\" href=\"/en/docs/variations/creation\" external={true} />\n\n  <Card subtitle=\"Fourth Component\" title=\"Managing Variations\" description=\"Managing existing variations - editing, deletion, inventory management and performance tracking.\" href=\"/en/docs/variations/management\" external={true} />\n</CardGrid>\n\n### System Architecture\n\n<img src=\"https://placehold.co/800x300?text=System+architecture+diagram\" alt=\"System architecture diagram\" />\n\nOur variations system is built for:\n\n1. **Scalability** - Handle thousands of variations effortlessly\n2. **Flexibility** - Adapt to any product type\n3. **Performance** - Quick loading and smooth operation\n\n### Getting Started\n\n<Step>\n  <StepItem title=\"Initial Planning\">\n    Before creating variations, consider:\n\n    1. The key features that distinguish your products\n    2. How many variations you'll need\n    3. Your inventory management requirements\n\n    <Note title=\"Tip\" type=\"info\">\n      Start with a simple structure and expand as needed. It's easier to add variations later than to simplify a complex structure.\n    </Note>\n  </StepItem>\n\n  <StepItem title=\"Basic Setup\">\n    To begin using the variations system:\n\n    1. Choose your product attributes\n    2. Define your options\n    3. Create your first variations\n\n    <Note title=\"Important\" type=\"warning\">\n      Plan your variation structure carefully as it can affect your store's performance and user experience.\n    </Note>\n  </StepItem>\n</Step>\n"
