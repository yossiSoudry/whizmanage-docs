description: Add various diagram types, including flowcharts, decision trees and entity-relationship diagrams.
---

Diagrams are powerful tools for visualizing processes, relationships, and decisions. This section showcases different types of diagrams created using **Mermaid**, complete with examples and reusable code snippets to integrate into your projects.

## Flowchart

A flowchart represents a sequence of steps or processes in a visual format. Use this diagram to map workflows, decision-making processes, or operational flows.

<Mermaid
  chart={`graph TD;
    Start --> Task1;
    Task1 --> Task2;
    Task2 --> End;`}
/>

```jsx
<Mermaid
  chart={\`
    graph TD;
    Start --> Task1;
    Task1 --> Task2;
    Task2 --> End;
  \`}
/>
```

## Decision Tree

Decision trees illustrate choices and possible outcomes, making them ideal for decision-making workflows or processes involving multiple paths.

<Mermaid
  chart={`graph TD;
    A[Start] --> B{Is it raining?};
    B -->|Yes| C[Take an umbrella];
    B -->|No| D[Enjoy the weather];
    C --> E[Go outside];
    D --> E;`}
/>

```jsx
<Mermaid
  chart={\`
    graph TD;
    A[Start] --> B{Is it raining?};
    B -->|Yes| C[Take an umbrella];
    B -->|No| D[Enjoy the weather];
    C --> E[Go outside];
    D --> E;
  \`}
/>
```

## Entity-Relationship Diagram

Entity-relationship diagrams (ERDs) are used to model relationships between entities in a system. They are widely used in database design and system architecture planning.

<Mermaid
  chart={`erDiagram
    CUSTOMER ||--o{ ORDER : places
    ORDER ||--|{ LINE-ITEM : contains
    PRODUCT ||--o{ LINE-ITEM : "included in"
    CUSTOMER {
        string name
        string email
    }
    ORDER {
        int orderNumber
        date orderDate
    }
    LINE-ITEM {
        int quantity
        float price
    }
    PRODUCT {
        int productId
        string name
        float price
    }`}
/>

```jsx
<Mermaid
  chart={\`
    erDiagram
    CUSTOMER ||--o{ ORDER : places
    ORDER ||--|{ LINE-ITEM : contains
    PRODUCT ||--o{ LINE-ITEM : "included in"
    CUSTOMER {
        string name
        string email
    }
    ORDER {
        int orderNumber
        date orderDate
    }
    LINE-ITEM {
        int quantity
        float price
    }
    PRODUCT {
        int productId
        string name
        float price
    }
  \`}
/>
```

Each of these diagrams serves a specific purpose and Mermaid makes it easy to generate them dynamically. Feel free to experiment with the provided code snippets and adapt them to your needs.
