## Our Online Store Policy

Welcome to our online store! Here, we sell our revolutionary software for managing WooCommerce stores on WordPress, allowing users to manage their online stores easily and conveniently. These terms apply to all purchases made in our store.

The software sold in the online store is carefully tested and provided according to the stated specifications. We guarantee that every product will meet the characteristics and features listed in the product specification on the website. The specification includes detailed information on product performance, technical features, and compatibility with different versions of WooCommerce and WordPress. Customers are requested to ensure that the purchased product meets their requirements and needs before making the purchase.

## Payments and Fees

**Service Fees**

We offer our support and update services according to the current price list published on our online store website ("Fees"). The price list is updated from time to time at our sole discretion.

**Payments**

All payments for the services will be made via credit card through our third-party payment service providers. The payments are subject to the service terms and privacy policies of the payment service providers.

**Additional Fees**

There may be additional fees related to payment processing, currency conversions, or international payments, depending on the terms of the payment service providers. Customers are responsible for paying these fees.

**Fee Updates**

We may update our fees from time to time or change the payment method according to our business needs and at our sole discretion. Any changes in fees or payment methods will be published on our website and communicated to registered customers via email or a prominent notice on the services.

**Consent to Changes**

By continuing to use the services after receiving notice of the changes, customers agree to be bound by the updated fees and terms. If customers do not agree to the changes, they must stop using the services before the changes take effect.

## Cancellations and Refunds

**Cancellation Policy**

Customers may cancel the services at any time through the user account on the website. The cancellation will take effect at the end of the current billing period, and no refund will be given for the remaining period.

**Refund Requests**

Refund requests will only be accepted in case of a technical fault or substantial non-compliance with the declared service specifications, at our sole discretion.

**Non-Refundable Fees**

Certain fees, such as payment processing fees or third-party service fees, are non-refundable in any case. We reserve the right to reject refund requests in cases of suspected bad faith, abuse of the services, or violation of any policy detailed in our terms and conditions.

## Licensing and Taxation

**Lifetime License**

A one-time purchase of the WhizManage license grants permanent access to the full version of the software, including regular updates, improvements, and future features â€” excluding AI-based functionalities.

AI-powered features are not included in the lifetime license and may require a separate subscription, additional payment, or the use of credits. This is due to the ongoing operational costs associated with these technologies and the third-party services they rely on.

In the event that new AI-based features are introduced, we will provide clear and transparent information regarding the terms required to access and use them.

**Tax Responsibility**

Users are solely responsible for paying all taxes related to purchases made through our services. The amount of fees may vary depending on the jurisdiction where the purchase was made, due to the imposition of local taxes. Therefore, relevant taxes may be added to the fee amount at the time of payment.

It is important to note that the fees do not include other taxes, such as income tax, VAT, or municipal taxes. Customers are solely responsible for reporting and paying all these taxes, including any fines or interest that may accrue.
