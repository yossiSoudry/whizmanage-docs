We will do our best to respond to every request within a reasonable time, according to the terms of the subscription plan purchased.

Account credentials allow us to verify identity and accurately categorize subscription plans. This ensures that appropriate services are received, including technical support and software updates. We use account credentials in accordance with our privacy policy to monitor the use of the software and prevent misuse, ensuring a fair experience for all WhizManage users.
