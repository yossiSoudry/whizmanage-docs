## Account Ownership

### Account Owner Definition

The account owner is the person who has access to the email address associated with the account. This means that this person is the only one who can log into the account, change its settings, and manage its activities. Even if multiple people use the same account, the account owner is the one responsible for it.

### Account Registration

When creating a new account, the user must provide a valid email address. This email address will be used as the account owner's identification.

### Email Address Verification

The user may be required to verify their email address by clicking a link sent to them. The verification process ensures that the user is the true owner of the email address. If the user does not verify their email address, they will not be able to use the account.

### Changing Email Address

The account owner may change the email address associated with their account at any time. To change the email address, the account owner will need to access their account settings and update the new email address. It is important to update the email address if it changes to continue receiving notifications and accessing the account.
