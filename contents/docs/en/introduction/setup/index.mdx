<StepItem title="Customizing Table Columns">

1. Open the main product table
2. Click the "+" (plus) button in the top corner of the table
3. In the window that opens, you can:
   - Check or uncheck columns to show/hide them
   - Change the order of columns by dragging and dropping within the window
   - Filter columns using the "Find column to show/hide" search field
4. After making your desired changes, click "Save as default" to save the settings for future use

Clicking "Save as default" will save the current column configuration as your default setting. If you want to return to the original settings, you can click "Reset Table".
</Note>
</StepItem>

<StepItem title="Changing Column Size and Order">

In addition to the settings window, you can make further adjustments directly in the table:

1. **Change column width** - drag the border between column headers to change the column width
2. **Change column order** - drag the column header to the desired position
3. **Quick column hiding** - click the small arrow next to the column header and select "Hide"
4. **Table sorting** - click on a column header to sort by that column, or click the small arrow and select "Asc" (ascending) or "Desc" (descending)

<StepItem title="Setting Rows Per Page">

You can adjust the number of products displayed on each page of the table:
