## Creating Product Variations

Creating product variations is a streamlined process that automatically generates all possible combinations of your product attributes and options.

### Before You Begin

Before creating variations, ensure you have:
1. Added all necessary attributes to your product
2. Defined the options for each attribute
3. Decided which attributes you want to include

### Setting Up Attribute Options

<Step>
<StepItem title="Configure Options for Each Attribute">

For each attribute:

1. Add all required options using either:
  * Product attribute options
  * Global attribute terms

2. Consider using "Any" option when:
  * All options have the same price
  * No separate inventory tracking is needed
  * No separate images are required

### Generating Variations

<Step>
<StepItem title="Automatic Combination Generation">

Once your attributes and options are set up:

1. Click the "Generate Variations" button
2. The system will automatically:
  * Create all possible combinations
  * Generate unique IDs for each variation
  * Set default values for price and stock

For example, with:
- Color: Red, Blue
- Size: S, M, L

The system will create 6 variations (2 colors Ã— 3 sizes)
