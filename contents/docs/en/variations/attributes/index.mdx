## What is a Product Attribute?

A product attribute is a characteristic that defines different aspects of your product. The system supports two main types of attributes, each serving different purposes.

### Types of Attributes

<Step>
<StepItem title="Product Attribute">

Product attributes are specific to an individual product.

**When to Use:**
- When the attribute is unique to this product
- When there's no need to share with other products
- When maximum flexibility is required

**Common Examples:**
- Storage capacity in mobile phones
- Frame material in glasses
- Engine type in vehicles

</StepItem>

<StepItem title="Global Attribute">

Global attributes are shared across multiple products and enable standardization.

**When to Use:**
- When the same attribute appears in multiple products
- When maintaining consistency across the store
- When filtering and searching by attribute is required

**Common Examples:**
- Clothing sizes (S, M, L)
- Standard colors
- Common materials

## Best Practices

1. **Plan Ahead**
  - Define attributes before adding products
  - Consider uniform structure for each category

2. **Maintain Consistency**
  - Use global attributes when possible
  - Keep names consistent and structure proper

3. **Documentation**
  - Document attribute usage
  - Perform periodic reviews to identify duplications

<Note title="Important" type="warning">
Take time to plan your attribute structure as it significantly impacts both store management and customer experience.
