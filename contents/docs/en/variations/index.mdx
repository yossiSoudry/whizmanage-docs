## Introduction

Product variations management is one of the most crucial components in running an online store. The system enables you to create different versions of the same basic product, such as different sizes and colors, while maintaining separate inventory tracking for each variation.

### What Are Product Variations?

Product variations allow you to offer the same product in multiple different versions. For example:
- A shirt in various colors and sizes
- A phone with different storage capacities
- Glasses with different frame colors
