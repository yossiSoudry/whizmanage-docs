## Cart Conditions

Conditions are one of the most powerful tools in the discount rules system. They allow you to define **when** a discount rule will be activated, based on the customer's cart content.

### What are Conditions?

<Step>
<StepItem title="Basic Definition">

**Conditions** are requirements that customers must meet for the rule to activate:

**Examples:**
- "Cart must contain at least $200"
- "Customer must purchase at least 3 items"
- "Electronics subtotal must be over $500"

**Without Conditions** = Rule always applies (if Filters exist, it applies to filtered products).

<img src="https://placehold.co/800x400?text=Conditions+Concept" alt="Conditions Concept" />

<Note title="Important" type="warning">
Conditions check **cart content**. Filters check **product attributes**. They're not the same!
</Note>
</StepItem>

<StepItem title="Difference Between Filters and Conditions">

This is a critical point to understand:

| | **Filters** | **Conditions** |
|---|-------------|----------------|
| **Asks** | "**Which** products?" | "**When** to activate?" |
| **Checks** | Product attributes | Cart content |
| **Example** | "Only shirts" | "Over $200" |
| **Effect** | Which products get discount | Whether rule activates at all |

**Practical Example:**
```
Promotion: 20% off shirts when purchasing over $300

Filters: Categories → Include → "Shirts"
  ↳ Discount applies only to shirts

Conditions: Subtotal (cart) ≥ 300
  ↳ Rule activates only if cart total is over $300
```

**Result:**
- Cart with shirts at $200 → ❌ No discount (doesn't meet condition)
- Cart with shirts at $400 → ✅ 20% off shirts
- Cart with shirts $100 + shoes $250 → ✅ 20% off shirts only

## Types of Conditions

The system supports 4 main condition types:

<Step>
<StepItem title="1. Subtotal (cart) - Total Cart Amount">

**Definition:** Total amount of all products in cart (before discounts and shipping)

**When to use:**
- Free shipping over amount
- General discount for large carts
- Encourage cart size increase

**Examples:**
- Subtotal (cart) **≥ 200** = "Over $200"
- Subtotal (cart) **≤ 500** = "Up to $500"
- Subtotal (cart) **= 100** = "Exactly $100"

<img src="https://placehold.co/800x400?text=Subtotal+Cart" alt="Subtotal Cart" />

**Practical Example:**
```
Name: "Free Shipping Over $200"
Type: Shipping discount
Settings: 100% discount on shipping
Filters: None
Conditions: Subtotal (cart) ≥ 200
```
</StepItem>

<StepItem title="2. Category Subtotal - Amount from Category">

**Definition:** Amount of products from specific category/categories in cart

**When to use:**
- Promotion on specific category with amount condition
- "Buy X from category Y over amount Z"
- Encourage purchasing from specific category

**Fields:**
- **Condition Type:** Category subtotal
- **Compare:** Comparison operator (≥, ≤, =, etc.)
- **Values:** Category selection
- **Amount:** Required amount

**Examples:**
```
Category subtotal
  Categories: "Electronics"
  Compare: ≥
  Amount: 500
= "Electronics amount in cart must be over $500"
```

<img src="https://placehold.co/800x400?text=Category+Subtotal" alt="Category Subtotal" />

**Practical Example:**
```
Name: "$50 off shoes when buying over $400 in shoes"
Type: Product adjustment
Settings: $50 discount
Filters: Categories → Include → "Shoes"
Conditions: 
  - Type: Category subtotal
  - Categories: "Shoes"
  - Compare: ≥
  - Amount: 400
```
</StepItem>

<StepItem title="3. Products Subtotal - Amount from Specific Products">

**Definition:** Amount from specific products you selected in cart

**When to use:**
- Promotion on specific products with amount condition
- "Buy products X,Y,Z over amount"
- Bundle deals on selected products

**Fields:**
- **Condition Type:** Products subtotal
- **Compare:** Comparison operator
- **Values:** Specific product selection
- **Amount:** Required amount

**Examples:**
```
Products subtotal
  Products: "HP Laptop", "Dell Laptop"
  Compare: ≥
  Amount: 3000
= "Selected laptops amount in cart over $3000"
```

<img src="https://placehold.co/800x400?text=Products+Subtotal" alt="Products Subtotal" />

**Practical Example:**
```
Name: "Buy Apple products over $5000 and get headphones free"
Type: BXGY
Settings: 
  Buy: Apple products
  Get: Headphones (100% discount)
Filters: None
Conditions:
  - Type: Products subtotal
  - Products: "iPhone 15", "MacBook Pro", "iPad"
  - Compare: ≥
  - Amount: 5000
```
</StepItem>

<StepItem title="4. Line Item Count - Number of Items">

**Definition:** Number of different items in cart (not total quantity!)

**When to use:**
- "Buy X different items"
- Encourage cart variety
- Promotions on item quantity

**Important to understand:**
- Counts by **number of lines** in cart
- 3 shirts of same product = **1 item**
- 3 different shirts = **3 items**

**Examples:**
```
Line Item Count ≥ 3
= "At least 3 different products in cart"
```

<img src="https://placehold.co/800x400?text=Line+Item+Count" alt="Line Item Count" />

**Practical Example:**
```
Name: "Buy 5 different products and get 10% off"
Type: Cart adjustment
Settings: 10% discount
Filters: None
Conditions: Line Item Count ≥ 5
```

<Note title="Tip" type="info">
If you want to count unit quantity (not different products), use Bulk Discount instead of Conditions.
</Note>
</StepItem>
</Step>

## Comparison Operators

Each condition uses a comparison operator:

<Step>
<StepItem title="Operator List">

| Symbol | Meaning | Example | Explanation |
|--------|---------|---------|-------------|
| **↑=** | Greater or equal | ≥ 200 | Over 200 or exactly 200 |
| **↓=** | Less or equal | ≤ 500 | Up to 500 including |
| **↑** | Greater than | > 100 | Over 100 (not including 100) |
| **↓** | Less than | < 1000 | Under 1000 (not including) |
| **=** | Equal to | = 50 | Exactly 50 |
| **=X** | Not equal to | ≠ 0 | Any value except 0 |

<img src="https://placehold.co/800x400?text=Comparison+Operators" alt="Comparison Operators" />

**Tips:**
- ✅ Use **≥** (greater or equal) for most cases - "over $200"
- ✅ Use **≤** (less or equal) for limited promotions - "up to $500"
- ⚠️ Be careful with **=** (exactly equal) - rarely needed
</StepItem>
</Step>

## Match ALL vs Match ANY

When you have more than one condition, you need to choose the logic:

<Step>
<StepItem title="Match ALL - Meet All Conditions">

**Definition:** Customer must meet **all** conditions you defined

**When to use:**
- When multiple requirements are mandatory
- Complex promotions with several conditions
- When you want to be strict

**Example:**
```
Match ALL:
  1. Subtotal (cart) ≥ 300
  2. Line Item Count ≥ 3

Meaning: 
  Customer needs to purchase over $300 **and** at least 3 different products
```

**Scenarios:**
| Amount | Items | Result |
|--------|-------|--------|
| $350 | 4 items | ✅ Meets both |
| $400 | 2 items | ❌ Not enough items |
| $250 | 5 items | ❌ Not enough amount |

<img src="https://placehold.co/800x400?text=Match+ALL" alt="Match ALL" />
</StepItem>

<StepItem title="Match ANY - Meet At Least One Condition">

**Definition:** Customer needs to meet **at least one** of the conditions

**When to use:**
- When there are multiple ways to earn discount
- Flexible promotions
- When you want to give customers options

**Example:**
```
Match ANY:
  1. Subtotal (cart) ≥ 500
  2. Line Item Count ≥ 5

Meaning:
  Customer needs to purchase over $500 **or** at least 5 different products
```

**Scenarios:**
| Amount | Items | Result |
|--------|-------|--------|
| $600 | 2 items | ✅ Meets amount |
| $300 | 7 items | ✅ Meets items |
| $400 | 4 items | ❌ Meets neither |

<img src="https://placehold.co/800x400?text=Match+ANY" alt="Match ANY" />
</StepItem>
</Step>

<StepItem title="Example 1: Free Shipping Over Amount">

**Goal:** Free shipping for anyone purchasing over $200

```
Name: "Free Shipping Over $200"
Type: Shipping discount
Settings: 100% discount
Filters: None
Conditions:
  Logic: Match ALL (doesn't matter, only one condition)
  - Subtotal (cart) ≥ 200
```

**How it works:**
- Customer with $150 cart → ❌ Pays for shipping
- Customer with $250 cart → ✅ Free shipping

<img src="https://placehold.co/800x400?text=Example+1" alt="Example 1" />
</StepItem>

<StepItem title="Example 2: Category Discount with Condition">

**Goal:** 20% off electronics when purchasing over $1000 in electronics

```
Name: "20% off electronics over $1000"

Settings: 20% discount
Filters: 
  - Categories → Include → "Electronics"
Conditions:
  Logic: Match ALL
  - Type: Category subtotal
  - Categories: "Electronics"
  - Compare: ≥
  - Amount: 1000
```

**How it works:**
- Cart: Laptop $800 → ❌ No discount (didn't reach $1000)
- Cart: Laptop $800 + Mouse $250 → ✅ 20% off both
- Cart: Laptop $1200 + Shoes $300 → ✅ 20% off laptop only

<img src="https://placehold.co/800x400?text=Example+2" alt="Example 2" />
</StepItem>

<StepItem title="Example 3: Complex Promotion with 2 Conditions">

**Goal:** 15% discount when purchasing over $400 **and** at least 3 different products

```
Name: "15% discount - $400 + 3 items"
Type: Cart adjustment
Settings: 15% discount
Filters: None
Conditions:
  Logic: Match ALL (must meet both!)
  1. Subtotal (cart) ≥ 400
  2. Line Item Count ≥ 3
```

**How it works:**
| Cart | Amount | Items | Result |
|------|--------|-------|--------|
| 3 different shirts + pants | $450 | 4 | ✅ 15% discount |
| 5 identical shirts | $500 | 1 | ❌ No discount |
| 2 items | $600 | 2 | ❌ No discount |

<img src="https://placehold.co/800x400?text=Example+3" alt="Example 3" />
</StepItem>

<StepItem title="Example 4: Match ANY - Flexible Options">

Settings: 10% discount
Filters: None
Conditions:
  Logic: Match ANY (one is enough)
  1. Subtotal (cart) ≥ 500
  2. Line Item Count ≥ 5
```

**How it works:**
| Cart | Amount | Items | Result |
|------|--------|-------|--------|
| 6 cheap items | $300 | 6 | ✅ 10% discount (meets items) |
| One expensive item | $700 | 1 | ✅ 10% discount (meets amount) |
| 3 items | $400 | 3 | ❌ No discount (meets neither) |

<img src="https://placehold.co/800x400?text=Example+4" alt="Example 4" />
</StepItem>

<StepItem title="Example 5: Complex Condition with 3 Conditions">

**Goal:** Free shipping for purchasing:
- Over $300 general **or**

- At least 4 sports products

```
Name: "Free shipping - 3 flexible conditions"

## Advanced Combinations

<Step>
<StepItem title="Combining Filters + Conditions">

Real power comes from proper combination of Filters and Conditions:

**Example 1: Targeted Discount**
```
Goal: 30% off children's clothing when purchasing over $200 in clothing

Filters: 
  - Categories → Include → "Children's Clothing"
Conditions:
  - Category subtotal → "Children's Clothing", "Baby Clothing" ≥ 200
```

**Example 2: Conditional BOGO**
```
Goal: Buy 2 shirts get 1 free - only for carts over $150

Type: BOGO
Settings: Buy 2, Get 1 (100%)
Filters:
  - Categories → Include → "Shirts"
Conditions:
  - Subtotal (cart) ≥ 150
```

<img src="https://placehold.co/800x400?text=Advanced+Combinations" alt="Advanced Combinations" />
</StepItem>

<StepItem title="Discount Tiers Without Bulk Discount">

You can create discount tiers using multiple rules:

```
Rule 1: "5% over $200"
  Priority: 20
  Type: Cart adjustment
  Settings: 5%
  Conditions: Subtotal ≥ 200

Rule 2: "10% over $500"
  Priority: 10
  Type: Cart adjustment
  Settings: 10%
  Conditions: Subtotal ≥ 500

Rule 3: "15% over $1000"
  Priority: 0
  Type: Cart adjustment
  Settings: 15%
  Conditions: Subtotal ≥ 1000
```

**Result:**
- $150 → No discount
- $300 → 5% discount
- $700 → 10% discount
- $1500 → 15% discount

</StepItem>
</Step>

## Tips and Best Practices

<Step>
<StepItem title="1. Start Simple">

**Don't complicate immediately:**
- Start with one condition
- Test that it works
- Add more conditions gradually

**Progress example:**
```
Step 1: No Conditions
  ↓ Tested, works
Step 2: + Subtotal ≥ 200
  ↓ Tested, works
Step 3: + Line Item Count ≥ 3
  ↓ Tested, works - Done!
```

<img src="https://placehold.co/800x400?text=Start+Simple" alt="Start Simple" />
</StepItem>

<StepItem title="2. Test in Real Cart">

**Before launch:**
1. Create cart exactly as customer would
2. Check discount appears/doesn't appear correctly
3. Try edge cases:
   - Exactly on threshold ($199.99 vs $200)
   - Below threshold
   - Way above threshold

**Edge cases to test:**
```
If condition: Subtotal ≥ 200

Test:
  ✅ $199 → No discount
  ✅ $200 → Has discount
  ✅ $201 → Has discount
  ✅ $500 → Has discount
```

<img src="https://placehold.co/800x400?text=Test+In+Cart" alt="Test In Cart" />
</StepItem>

<StepItem title="3. Beware of Conflicting Conditions">

**Common problem:** Two conditions that can't both be true

**Problem example:**
```
❌ Wrong:
  Match ALL:
    1. Subtotal (cart) ≥ 500
    2. Subtotal (cart) ≤ 300

  ↳ No cart will meet both conditions!
```

**Solution:**
```
✅ Correct:
  Match ALL:
    1. Subtotal (cart) ≥ 300
    2. Subtotal (cart) ≤ 500

  ↳ Carts between $300-$500
```

<img src="https://placehold.co/800x400?text=Avoid+Conflicts" alt="Avoid Conflicts" />
</StepItem>

<StepItem title="4. Document Intent">

**In Message field or rule name:**
- Explain what the rule should do
- Document conditions in plain language
- This will help you in the future

**Good example:**
```
Name: "Free shipping over $200 - until 12/31"
Message: "You got free shipping! Keep shopping over $200"
```

<img src="https://placehold.co/800x400?text=Document+Intent" alt="Document Intent" />
</StepItem>

<StepItem title="5. Proper Use of Match ALL/ANY">

**Rule of thumb:**

**Match ALL** when:
- All conditions are mandatory
- Want to be strict
- Expensive/limited promotion

**Match ANY** when:
- Multiple ways to qualify
- Want to be flexible
- Broad promotion

**Example:**
```
Match ALL: "Over $500 **and** 5 items"
  ↳ Strict - only large customers

Match ANY: "Over $500 **or** 5 items"
  ↳ Flexible - more customers qualify
```

<img src="https://placehold.co/800x400?text=ALL+vs+ANY" alt="ALL vs ANY" />
</StepItem>

## Frequently Asked Questions

<Step>
<StepItem title="Are Conditions mandatory?">

**No!** Conditions are optional:

- **Without Conditions** = Rule always applies
- **With Conditions** = Rule applies only when conditions are met

**When you don't need Conditions:**
- Simple category discount (Filters are enough)
- BOGO without restrictions
- General site-wide promotion
</StepItem>

<StepItem title="What's the difference between Category subtotal and Products subtotal?">

**Category subtotal:**
- Amount from entire category
- Example: All "Electronics" products

**Products subtotal:**
- Amount from specific products you selected
- Example: Only "iPhone 15" and "iPad Pro"

**When to use each:**
- Category = When there are many products in category
- Products = When you want precise control over specific products
</StepItem>

<StepItem title="Can I combine Filters with Conditions?">

**Yes! And recommended!**

This is the most powerful combination:
- **Filters** = Which products
- **Conditions** = When to activate

**Example:**
```
Promotion: 20% off clothing when purchasing over $300

Filters: Categories → "Clothing"
  ↳ Discount only on clothing

Conditions: Subtotal (cart) ≥ 300
  ↳ Rule activates only over $300
```
</StepItem>

<StepItem title="What happens if customer doesn't meet conditions?">

**Simply - rule doesn't apply:**
- No discount
- No message
- Rule just ignores the cart

**Customer doesn't know:**
- That such rule exists
- That they almost met condition
- How much is missing

**Tip:** Use Message to encourage:
```
Message: "$50 more and you'll get free shipping!"
```
</StepItem>

<StepItem title="Can I create very complex Conditions?">

**Yes, but:**
- ✅ Can add many conditions
- ⚠️ Keep it simple - easier to manage
- ⚠️ Test thoroughly - more conditions = more room for errors

**Recommendation:**
- Up to 3 conditions = Excellent
- 4-5 conditions = OK but test well
- 6+ conditions = Consider splitting into multiple rules
</StepItem>
</Step>

---

## Summary

**Conditions are a powerful tool for creating smart promotions:**

🎯 **4 Condition Types:**
1. Subtotal (cart) - Cart amount
2. Category subtotal - Amount from category
3. Products subtotal - Amount from specific products
4. Line Item Count - Number of different items

🔧 **2 Logic Modes:**
- Match ALL - Meet all conditions
- Match ANY - Meet at least one condition

💡 **Guiding Principles:**
- Start simple
- Test in real cart
- Combine with Filters for maximum power
- Document intent

**Remember:** Filters = "Which products", Conditions = "When"
