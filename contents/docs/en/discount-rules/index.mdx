## Discount Rules - Advanced Promotions Management

Whizmanage's Discount Rules system allows you to create and manage complex, advanced discount promotions with ease. With an intuitive interface and powerful tools, you can define custom discounts that perfectly match your sales strategy.

### What are Discount Rules?

Discount rules are automatic rules that apply discounts to products or shopping carts based on conditions you define. Unlike regular coupons, discount rules work automatically without requiring a code entry.

### Discount Rule Types

The system supports a wide variety of discount types:

1. **Product Adjustment** - Discount on specific products
2. **Cart Adjustment** - Discount on entire cart
3. **Bulk Discount** - Tiered discounts by quantity
4. **BOGO** - Buy X Get Y (same product)
5. **BXGY** - Buy X Get Y (different products)
6. **Shipping Discount** - Discount on shipping
7. **Spend Bundle** - Bundle deals

<Note title="Tip" type="info">
Each discount type comes with its own dedicated settings. For example, BOGO allows you to set different quantities and products for purchase and gift.
</Note>

### Basic Rule Components

Every discount rule consists of several main components:

<Step>
<StepItem title="Basic Details">

**Rule Name** - A descriptive name that helps you identify the rule

**Discount Type** - Select the appropriate discount type (Product, Cart, BOGO, etc.)

**Discount Settings** - The settings button allows you to configure the discount method, percentages, fixed amounts, and more

</StepItem>

<StepItem title="Filters - Product Filtering">

Filters allow you to limit the rule to specific products:
- **Categories** - Include or exclude categories
- **Tags** - Filter by product tags
- **Attributes** - Filter by attributes like color, size
- **Specific Products** - Manual product selection
- **On Sale** - Only sale products or vice versa

<img src="https://placehold.co/800x300?text=Product+filters" alt="Product filters" />

<Note title="Important" type="warning">
Filters determine **which products** the rule applies to. If no Filters are set, the rule applies to all products.
</Note>
</StepItem>

<StepItem title="Conditions - Cart Conditions">

Conditions determine **when** the rule will activate based on cart contents:
- **Subtotal** - Minimum cart amount
- **Category Subtotal** - Amount from specific category
- **Products Subtotal** - Amount from specific products
- **Item Count** - Number of items in cart

Each condition includes:
- **Condition Type** - Cart, category, products
- **Comparison Operator** - Greater than, less than, equal
- **Value** - The required amount or quantity

<img src="https://placehold.co/800x300?text=Cart+conditions" alt="Cart conditions" />

<Note title="Tip" type="info">
You can set multiple conditions and choose whether the customer needs to meet all conditions (Match ALL) or at least one (Match ANY).
</Note>
</StepItem>

<StepItem title="Schedule and Priority">

**Dates** - Set the rule's active period:
- Start date
- End date
- Leave empty = no time limit

**Priority** - Number that determines rule application order when multiple rules are relevant. Lower value = higher priority.

**Status** - Quick enable/disable of the rule:
- 🟢 Active
- ⚫ Draft

### Difference Between Filters and Conditions

This is one of the important things to understand:

| Aspect | Filters | Conditions |
|--------|---------|------------|
| **Purpose** | Determine **which products** the rule applies to | Determine **when** the rule activates |
| **Based On** | Product attributes (category, tag, SKU) | Cart contents (amount, quantity) |
| **Example** | "Only products from clothing category" | "When cart total exceeds $100" |
| **Default** | All products | All carts |

<Note title="Practical Example" type="info">
**Scenario:** 20% discount on clothing when purchasing over $200

- **Filters:** Category = "Clothing" (only clothing gets discount)
- **Conditions:** Subtotal ≥ 200 (rule only activates if cart exceeds $200)
</Note>
