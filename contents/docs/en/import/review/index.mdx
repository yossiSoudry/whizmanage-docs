### Advanced Tips for Review Mode

1. **Efficient Editing**
   - Use keyboard shortcuts for quick navigation in the table
   - Edit multiple rows simultaneously using multiple selection
   - Perform bulk actions on selected products

2. **Quality Control**
   - First check the most important products
   - Look for recurring patterns of errors
   - Use search and filter functions to find outlier values

3. **Data Preservation**
   - Review mode automatically saves changes
   - If a break is needed, you can return to review mode later
   - For safety, take screenshots of significant changes

<Note title="Important" type="warning">
Although review mode allows many corrections, proper planning of the original file before import will save considerable time at this stage.
