### WooCommerce File Structure

A standard WooCommerce file includes the following main columns:

| Column | Description | Example |
|-------|--------|--------|
| **ID** | Unique product identifier | 123 |
| **Type** | Product type | simple, variable, variation |
| **SKU** | Unique catalog number | ABC-123 |
| **Name** | Product name | Cotton Shirt |
| **Published** | Publication status | 1 (yes) or 0 (no) |
| **Regular price** | Regular price | 99.90 |
| **Sale price** | Sale price | 79.90 |
| **Categories** | Categories | Clothing, Shirts |
| **Images** | Links to images | http://example.com/image.jpg |
| **Attribute X name** | Attribute name | Color |
| **Attribute X value(s)** | Attribute values | Red, Blue, Green |

<Note title="Important" type="warning">
The WhizManage system automatically identifies columns even if they're in Hebrew, but it's recommended to use an English file for maximum compatibility.
</Note>

### Handling Variations

When importing products with variations:

1. **File Structure**
   - The parent product (`variable`) appears first
   - Followed by all variations (`variation`)
   - Variations are linked to the parent via the `Parent` field

2. **Attribute Handling**
   - `Attribute X name` columns define attribute names
   - `Attribute X value(s)` columns define the options
   - `Attribute X visible` columns define if the attribute is visible
   - `Attribute X global` columns define if the attribute is global

### Tips for Successful Import from WooCommerce

1. **File Preparation**
   - Maintain the original column structure
   - Ensure SKUs are unique
   - Verify that image links are valid and accessible

2. **During Import**
   - Start with a small import for testing
   - Pay attention to required fields
   - Use the review table to verify data accuracy

3. **Troubleshooting Common Issues**
   - Character encoding issues: ensure the file is in UTF-8 encoding
   - Attribute issues: check the structure and format of attribute values
   - Product relationships: ensure correct order of parent products and variations

<Note title="Important" type="warning">
Complex imports with hundreds of products and variations may take a long time. Do not close the window or refresh the page during the process.
